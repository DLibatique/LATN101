## Detailed Schedule
All assignments listed below will be found in our textbook (= **T**) or workbook (= **W**). I reserve the right to alter any given day’s homework assignment by adding to, changing, or taking away from what is posted below.

Each entry lists the topic of discussion for that day in class plus *the homework assignment that will be collected that day*. E.g.,³ on Monday, September 3, I will collect textbook chapter 1, exercises 1, 2, and 3, and your signed statement for the workbook exercise from chapter 1 (see "Homework" under "Assessment & Grades" above).

You should also read the chapter that will be discussed on any given day in advance of the class meeting. E.g., by the time class meets on Friday, August 31, you should have already read through Chapter 1.

³ **FUN FACT #3:** “e.g.” stands for *exemplī gratiā*, or “for the sake of an example”!
