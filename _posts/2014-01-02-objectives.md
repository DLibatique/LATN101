## Course Objectives
This course is an introduction to the Latin language, the mode of communication that defines the literature and culture of ancient Rome. No previous knowledge of Latin is required. This course will start from the very basics of the Latin language (i.e.,¹ parts of speech, inflection, pronunciation) and eventually build towards a strong command of Latin vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. The goal of first-year Latin (consisting of this course and its counterpart and continuation, LATN 102 - Introduction to Latin 2) is to build a solid foundation for reading actual ancient Roman texts. As such, the acquisition of those linguistic skills, elucidated and practiced through classroom instruction and examples in our textbook and workbook, will also be reinforced by the reading of select prose and poetry passages in Latin.

¹ **FUN FACT #1:** “i.e.” stands for *id est*, or “that is [to say]”!
